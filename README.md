## Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics
## Subject: Programming and Scripting
## Teacher: Andrew Beatty
## Year: 2024
## Author: Gabriela Domiciano Avellar 

I study at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie).

### Introduction
During the programming and Scripting course, we developed tasks proposed by the teacher, in these weeks, we learned how to use Python, each week we were given classes and ended with the tasks. In this project, you will be able to see all the proposed tasks and the evolution of learning.

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è
To follow and run the codes you will need to install Python on your computer.
You can install Anaconda, on the website you will find a free package and management environment that includes all the necessary packages and libraries for Python programming language.

 - Anaconda: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com).

 - Pyhton: [Pyhton](https://www.python.org).

Python libraries are useful functions and modules that reduce code usage in the program.

- Pandas: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)

- Numpy: [Numpy](https://numpy.org)

- Matplotlib: [Matpltlib](https://matplotlib.org)

The editor I used to create Python scripts: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
