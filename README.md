# Pands-weekly-tasks

## Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics
## Subject: Programming and Scripting
## Teacher: Andrew Beatty
## Year: 2024
## Author: Gabriela Domiciano Avellar 

I study at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie).

During the 8 weeks of the programming and Scripting course, we developed tasks proposed by the teacher, in these 8 weeks we learned how to use Pyhton, each week we were given classes and ended with the tasks. In this project you will be able to see all the proposed tasks and the evolution of learning.

To be able to follow and understand the codes you will need to install Python on your computer.
You can install Anaconda, on the website you will find a free package and management environment that includes all the necessary packages and libraries for Python programming language.
