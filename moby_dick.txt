Moby Dick Quotes

"Better to sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunk Christian"

"I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will, I'll go to it laughing."

"As for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. "

"I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts."

"Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
 drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin 
 warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever
  my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me 
  from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off - then, 
  I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.‚Äù
